1) Introduction
   ------------
Xcode offers a framework creation project template for MacOS applications, but no such template
is provided for iOS. One of the reasons is probably that a framework is an NSBundle, of which
no other instance than the main bundle can exist on iOS. The stems from the fact that an NSBundle
must contain executable code, otherwise it cannot be loaded (and therefore its resources cannot be
accessed). Since iOS applications run in sandboxes, they are not allowed to use shared libraries,
and therefore bundles cannot be loaded. Thus, for applications running on iOS, there is
no way to load something like a framework, therefore no corresponding template is provided.

But still one should have a way of reusing library code. Xcode provides a static library project
template, with which static library files can be created. 

Usually, this is achieved by
checking out the source code of a library before adding it as a reference to a project.
This approach works but is not really convenient. Moreover it exposes the source code,
which might not be desired for commercial libraries.

Xcode offers a static library project,
but different libraries have to be linked whether we target the siumlator or the device
itself. Moreover, libraries do not pack resources, neither do they offer a way to expose
their public interface headers in a convenient way.
